## My process

What I did first was change the initial page header and then I changed the background color.

I created an embedded div for the image and styled it (giving position and size) using css.
I then created another div for the details and styled it with css.

From this challenge i have learned how to create variables in css

}
.card-image {
    height: 250px;
    width:  250px; 
    padding: 8px;
